        <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>At the very top, we see the !DOCTYPE html declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
       <li>The html opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. Inside the <html> tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English). An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
       <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
       <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
       <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
       <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
       <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
       <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>

       <li>The Html and CSS files need to be linked by adding the " link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" onto the header of the HTML file</li>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       <li>Class selectors can be used to style and target different sections </li>

      <li>git add -A commits all files in the working branch</li>
